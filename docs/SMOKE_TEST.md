# Local relay smoke test

Start the gateway and mock connector as described in the root README. Connect a WebSocket client to `ws://127.0.0.1:8787/v1/connect` and send:

```json
{"type":"hello","version":1,"role":"app","deviceId":"android-dev","token":"dev-app"}
```

Then send:

```json
{"type":"command","version":1,"id":"request-1","targetDeviceId":"mac-mini","payload":{"kind":"chat","input":"hello"}}
```

Expected terminal event:

```json
{"type":"event","version":1,"requestId":"request-1","event":"complete","data":{"sessionId":"request-1"}}
```

## Hermes compatibility smoke test

The repository also includes a protocol-shaped Mock Hermes server that requires the same Basic Auth → Cookie → WS Ticket sequence as the real dashboard.

Run the Mock Hermes server, Gateway, and Connector on separate terminals, then run:

```bash
npm run smoke:compat
```

The test passes only after `/api/status` traverses the REST tunnel and a JSON-RPC request traverses `/api/ws` in both directions.

With `HERMES_MODE=live`, the Connector also opens a private observer socket. Confirm its log contains
`Hermes lifecycle observer connected`, then query the Relay inbox without exposing the token in the
URL:

```bash
curl -H "X-Hermes-Session-Token: $APP_TOKEN" \
  "http://127.0.0.1:8787/api/mobile/events?after=0&limit=20"
```

Start and finish a Hermes task from another local client. Expect exactly one ordered set of lifecycle
transitions, no prompt/tool/file content in the JSON, and no duplicates after restarting the
Connector. Stop the Mac Connector and repeat the GET: persisted events must still be available.
After noting an event ID, verify both idempotent state routes:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "X-Hermes-Session-Token: $APP_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"event_ids":["EVENT_ID"]}' \
  http://127.0.0.1:8787/api/mobile/events/ack
curl -X POST -H "X-Hermes-Session-Token: $APP_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"event_ids":["EVENT_ID"]}' \
  http://127.0.0.1:8787/api/mobile/events/read
```

### Android notification and battery checks

1. Enable notifications and keep **Smart** selected. While the app is open, create and complete a
   task from another client; the event should appear within a few seconds without a permanent
   foreground-service notification. Its session row should move through running, waiting (when
   applicable), and completed/unread states.
2. Start a task from Android, put the app in the background, and confirm one ongoing service
   notification remains while the run is active. Complete the task and confirm the completion
   notification replaces the running state and the service stops.
3. With no Android-started task active, leave the app in the background. Confirm there is no
   persistent service and no idle gateway ping loop. A task completed elsewhere should be found by
   the next OS-managed periodic check; Android may defer that check beyond 15 minutes.
4. Repeat a delivered Relay batch or restart Android between notification delivery and cursor
   persistence. Confirm the stable notification is updated rather than duplicated.
5. Select **Real-time** and confirm the background service remains present. Select **Power saving**
   and confirm the service stops even when a locally started run is still active.
6. Deny notification permission and verify chat remains functional. On Android 13+, re-enable the
   permission in system settings and repeat the lock-screen and heads-up checks for each channel.

For a deployed relay, set `PUBLIC_GATEWAY_URL` and `APP_TOKEN` in the invoking shell before running the same script. Keep the token out of command history and source control. A successful real-Hermes run accepts `gateway.ready` and any non-error result from `session.create`.

## Attachment and large-response smoke test

With Gateway and Connector running locally and `FILES_ROOT` pointing at a dedicated test directory:

1. Upload a small text, PDF, and processed photo through the Android attachment sheet. Confirm each
   appears on the outgoing user turn and Hermes receives the attachment before the prompt.
2. Capture a photo with the system camera, cancel once, then capture successfully. Confirm cancel is
   harmless and the successful capture produces a thumbnail.
3. Have Hermes return `@image:/absolute/path/to/image.png` and `@file:/absolute/path/to/report.pdf`.
   Confirm the image opens full screen and the file card opens/shares through the Android system UI.
4. Download a file larger than the former whole-message ceiling (for example 24 MiB but below
   `MAX_FILE_BYTES`). Confirm the download completes and the Connector remains online afterward.
5. Attempt a path outside `FILES_ROOT`, an upload above `MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES`, and a download above
   `MAX_FILE_BYTES`. Expect request-scoped 403/413 errors with no control-WebSocket disconnect.
