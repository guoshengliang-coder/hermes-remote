# Local relay smoke test

Start the gateway and mock connector as described in the root README. Connect a WebSocket client to `ws://127.0.0.1:8787/v1/connect` and send:

```json
{"type":"hello","version":1,"role":"app","deviceId":"android-dev","token":"dev-app"}
```

Then send:

```json
{"type":"command","version":1,"id":"request-1","targetDeviceId":"mac-mini","payload":{"kind":"chat","input":"hello"}}
```

Expected terminal event:

```json
{"type":"event","version":1,"requestId":"request-1","event":"complete","data":{"sessionId":"request-1"}}
```
